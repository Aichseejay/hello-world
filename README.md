GitHub told me to do this against my will

Why, hello there fellow curious kid who spends too much time on GitHub searching through the most remote projects. You are welcome to look at this text for as long as you would like, truly.

HOT OPINIONS that I dug from not too far in the past (not my actual opinions right now):

It’s great to know that you are not (completely) [might want to take out the word ‘completely’] unique

The people that say, “We are all the same” are as wrong as the people that say, “We are all unique.” We are not all the same by any means. We each live different lives based on how we were raised, the time period we are born in and many other factors that we can’t always control. Trying to purely use only your own experiences to deeply understand another person whether they be family, friends, or a co(-)worker [might not need ‘-’] will not work.

In a similar way saying that we are all unique is also flawed. There are plenty of common things we all do, or at least must do to survive: eat, drink, and sleep. Even when ignoring the basic ways of survival it must be known that most people are normal and even when someone feels a little crazy it isn’t at all improbable that more than a million people are feeling similarly. See even when major breakthroughs in thought are seemingly discovered it can be trustfully bet that many others have already thought in that exact same way. This is what support groups rely on-- the fact that others have experienced, thought, explored their minds, and done similar feats to one another.

So with this knowledge we can know that if we are going completely mad one day that we aren’t alone with these thoughts of life, work, school, or death. We are never alone when thinking.
